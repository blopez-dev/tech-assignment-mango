# Mango Technical Assignment Pablo J. García

This is a project created for the Mango test by Pablo J. García.

## The improvements I would have liked to make if I had more time are:

- Improving application coverage (currently at 76%), and adding integration tests with Cypress to verify services
- Enhancing the application architecture by optimizing files and folders
- Do a better search solution for more optimal results.

## How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the project dependencies by running the command: `npm install`
2. Start the development server by running the command: `npm run dev`
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## How to Test

To run the tests for this project, use the following command: `npm run test`

This will run all the available tests and provide the test results in the terminal.

Please note that you need to have the project dependencies installed before running the tests.

## How to View test coverage

To check the coverage of the application, run the command: `npm run coverage`
The "coverage" folder will automatically be generated.
Inside that folder, you will find the index.html file, which is executable in a web browser.
